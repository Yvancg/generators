**generate-password** creates realistic US phone numbers, optionally scoped by state or city.
It supports deterministic seeding, batch generation, and consistent formatting.

---

## 🚀 Why

Most phone number generators rely on external datasets or inconsistent formatting.
`generate-password` is a clean, deterministic module that runs everywhere with zero dependencies.

---

## 🌟 Features

-	✅ US-format phone numbers (AAA) BBB-CCCC
-	✅ Optional state targeting (area-code mapping)
-	✅ Optional city mapping when supported
-	✅ Deterministic output via seed
-	✅ Generate one or many at once
-	✅ Works in Node.js, Deno, Bun, and browsers
-	✅ Zero dependencies — pure ES module

---

## 📦 Usage

```js
import { generatePhoneNumbers } from './phone.js';

// Generate a single random US phone number
console.log(generatePhoneNumbers());
// → ["(415) 392-8127"]

// Generate 5 phone numbers from California
console.log(generatePhoneNumbers({ state: "CA", count: 5 }));
// → ["(213) 555-4821", "(415) 290-1833", ...]

// Deterministic list with seed
console.log(generatePhoneNumbers({ count: 3, seed: "demo" }));
// → ["(646) 201-4922", "(305) 440-9821", "(512) 933-4408"]

// Target a specific city (if known)
console.log(generatePhoneNumbers({ city: "San Francisco", count: 2 }));
// → ["(415) 328-9012", "(628) 440-5511"]
```

## 🧠 API

### `generatePhoneNumbers(options?: PhoneOptions): string[]`

**Options**
```ts
type PhoneOptions = {
  state?: string | null;
  city?: string | null;
  count?: number;
  seed?: string | null;
};
```
Returns an array of formatted US phone numbers.

---

## 🛠 Development

This module is standalone. Copy `phone.js` into your project.  
No `npm install` or build step required.

Run quick test in Node:
```bash
node --input-type=module -e "import('./phone.js').then(m=>console.log(m.generatePhoneNumbers({count:3})))"
```

## 🔒 Notes

• Uses crypto.getRandomValues() for randomness when available.
• Deterministic seed mode is for testing only.
• Area code mappings are simplified for consistency and stability.
