**generate-fake-data** creates seedable, dependency-free fake data for tests, demos, and AI dataset prototyping.

---

## üöÄ Why

Most fake data libraries rely on massive datasets or unsafe randomness.
`generate-fake-data` is small, deterministic, and dependency-free ‚Äî ideal for reproducible test runs, mock APIs, or synthetic AI inputs.

---

## üåü Features

- ‚úÖ Deterministic output via `seed`
- ‚úÖ Names, emails, phones (E.164-ish), addresses, companies
- ‚úÖ Pure ESM, no deps, O(n)
- ‚úÖ Works in Node, Deno, Bun, or browser
- ‚úÖ Generates entire fake datasets in O(n)

---

## üì¶ Usage

```js
import { rows, rng, user } from './fake.js';

// Generate deterministic fake dataset
console.log(rows(3, 42));
// ‚Üí array of 3 user objects

// Generate a single deterministic user
const R = rng(42);
console.log(user(R));
// ‚Üí { id: "u_123456", name: "Emma Brown", ... }
```

---

## üß† API

```ts
rng(seed?: number|string): () => number
rows(count?: number, seed?: number|string): Array<User>
user(R?: () => number): User
firstName(R): string
lastName(R): string
fullName(R): string
email(name?: string, R?, domain?: string): string
phoneE164(R, cc?: string): string
address(R): { line1, city, state, zip, country }
company(R): string
```
Returns a string containing the generated password.

## Example Output

```bash
{
  "id": "u_391823",
  "name": "Ava Johnson",
  "email": "ava.johnson@example.com",
  "phone": "+15554443322",
  "address": {
    "line1": "8741 Maple St",
    "city": "Austin",
    "state": "TX",
    "zip": "78701",
    "country": "US"
  },
  "company": "Quantum Labs"
}
```

## üß™ Browser test

Open `fake-test.html` in your browser  
or try the hosted demo üëâüèª 
[Generate Fake Data Test](https://yvancg.github.io/generators/generate-fake-data/fake-test.html)

---

## üõ† Development

This module is standalone. Copy `fake.js` into your project.  
No `npm install` or build step required.

Run quick test in Node:
```bash
node --input-type=module -e "import('./fake.js').then(m=>console.log(m.rows(3,42)))"
```

## üîí Notes

‚Ä¢	Phone format is simple +CC + 10 digits for portability.
‚Ä¢	Datasets are tiny on purpose; extend arrays as needed.
‚Ä¢	No PII sources; all names/domains are generic.
