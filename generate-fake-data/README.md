**generate-fake-data** creates seedable, dependency-free fake data for tests and demos.

---

## üöÄ Why

Most password generators depend on heavy libraries, weak pseudo-randomness, or unsafe string operations.  
`generate-password` is a small, auditable, and crypto-safe module that runs everywhere with zero dependencies.

---

## üåü Features

- ‚úÖ Deterministic output via `seed`
- ‚úÖ Names, emails, phones (E.164-ish), addresses, companies
- ‚úÖ Pure ESM, no deps, O(n)

---

## üì¶ Usage

```js
import { generatePassword } from './password.js';

generatePassword();
// ‚Üí 'fP8!cN9^hK2@xQ4?'

generatePassword({ length: 20, symbols: false });
// ‚Üí 'aJh7yP3bLq0vFs2TmR8z'

generatePassword({ length: 12, seed: 'demo-seed' });
// ‚Üí 'Xp7aK4FqJr2b'
```

‚Ä¢	Datasets are tiny on purpose; extend arrays as needed.
‚Ä¢	No PII sources; all names/domains are generic.
