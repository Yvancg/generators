**generate-card-number** creates seedable, dependency-free fake data for tests, demos, and AI dataset prototyping.

---

## üöÄ Why

Most Lorem Ipsum tools depend on large libraries or unsafe random generators.  
`generate-card-number` is compact, deterministic, and dependency-free ‚Äî ideal for reproducible content, AI dataset stubs, or testing pipelines.

---

## üåü Features

- ‚úÖ Deterministic output via `seed`  
- ‚úÖ Generates words, sentences, or paragraphs  
- ‚úÖ Adjustable word and sentence ranges  
- ‚úÖ Capitalization and punctuation options  
- ‚úÖ Works in Node.js, Deno, Bun, or browser  
- ‚úÖ Zero dependencies ‚Äî pure ESM  

---

## üì¶ Usage

```js
import { generateCard } from './card.js';

console.log(generateCard({ brand: 'visa', seed: 'demo' }));
// -> { number: '4111...1234', brand: 'visa', expiry: '09/28', cvc: '123' }
```

---

## üß† API

```ts
generateLorem(options?: LoremOptions): string

type LoremOptions = {
  units?: 'words' | 'sentences' | 'paragraphs';
  count?: number;
  seed?: string | null;
  dictionary?: string[];
  wordsPerSentence?: [number, number];
  sentencesPerParagraph?: [number, number];
  capitalize?: boolean;
  endWithPeriod?: boolean;
  separator?: string;
};
```
Returns a string of generated Lorem Ipsum text.

---

## Example Output

```bash
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipiscing elit. 
Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
```
With a seed:
```bash
console.log(generateLorem({ units: 'sentences', count: 2, seed: 'demo' }));
# Lorem dolore pariatur anim exercitation officia.
# Fugiat id consequat tempor in voluptate.
```

No `npm install` or build step required.

```

## üîí Notes

‚Ä¢	Output is synthetic and reproducible ‚Äî no external data.
‚Ä¢	All randomness uses crypto.getRandomValues when available.
‚Ä¢	Use the seed option for deterministic test results.
