**generate-hash** creates cryptographic and legacy hashes (SHA-256, MD5) for text input.  
Lightweight, dependency-free, and browser-compatible.

---

## 🚀 Why

Many hash utilities rely on large crypto packages or Node-only APIs.  
`generate-hash` uses native WebCrypto when available and includes a minimal MD5 fallback — ideal for secure client-side hashing, data integrity checks, or reproducible signatures.

---

## 🌟 Features

- ✅ SHA-256 (via SubtleCrypto) and MD5 (pure JS)  
- ✅ Browser, Node.js, Deno, Bun support  
- ✅ Minimal, dependency-free ESM  
- ✅ Deterministic, repeatable output  
- ✅ UTF-8 input handling  

---

## 📦 Usage

```js
import { generateHash } from './hash.js';

// SHA-256 hash
console.log(await generateHash('hello world', 'sha-256'));
// → 'b94d27b9934d3e08a52e52d7da7dabfac484efe37a5380ee9088f7ace2efcde9'

// MD5 hash
console.log(await generateHash('hello world', 'md5'));
// → '5eb63bbbe01eeed093cb22bb8f5acdc3'
```

---

## 🧠 API

```ts
generateHash(input: string, algorithm?: 'sha-256' | 'md5'): Promise<string>
```
Returns a lowercase hex-encoded hash string.

---

## Example Output

```bash
SHA-256 → b94d27b9934d3e08a52e52d7da7dabfac484efe37a5380ee9088f7ace2efcde9
MD5      → 5eb63bbbe01eeed093cb22bb8f5acdc3
```


## 🧪 Browser test

Open `hash-test.html` in your browser  
or try the hosted demo 👉🏻 
[Generate Hash Test](https://yvancg.github.io/generators/generate-hash/hash-test.html)

---

## 🛠 Development

This module is standalone. Copy `hash.js` into your project.  
No `npm install` or build step required.

Run quick test in Node:
```bash
node --input-type=module -e "import('./hash.js').then(async m=>console.log(await m.generateHash('test','sha-256')))"
```

---

## 🔒 Notes

•	Uses WebCrypto crypto.subtle.digest when available.
• MD5 is not secure — use only for checksums or legacy compatibility.
• SHA-256 is cryptographically safe for most integrity uses.
